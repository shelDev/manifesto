# Voice Journal Server-Side Storage Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing server-side storage for the Voice Journal application, addressing the limitations of client-side localStorage.

## Data Storage Requirements

### Journal Entry Data Structure
- **Text content**: Transcribed journal entries (potentially large text fields)
- **Audio recordings**: Voice recordings in compressed audio format (WAV, MP3)
- **Metadata**:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Last modified timestamp
  - Mood classification
  - Topics/tags
  - Title/summary
  - Sharing status and permissions
- **AI Analysis Results**:
  - Mood analysis
  - Topic extraction
  - Hero's journey narrative elements

### User Data
- User authentication information
- User preferences
- Profile information
- Usage statistics

### Storage Capacity
- Audio recordings will require significant storage capacity
- Estimate 1-5MB per audio recording
- Text and metadata will require minimal storage in comparison
- Plan for scalable storage solution

## Authentication Requirements

### User Authentication
- Secure registration and login system
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- OAuth integration options (Google, Apple, etc.)
- Session management
- Remember me functionality

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Owner permissions for entries
- Sharing permissions management
- API access tokens for secure communication

## API Requirements

### Core Endpoints
- **User Management**:
  - Register
  - Login
  - Update profile
  - Manage preferences
- **Journal Entries**:
  - Create entry
  - Read entry
  - Update entry
  - Delete entry
  - List entries with filtering/pagination
- **Audio Management**:
  - Upload recording
  - Stream recording
  - Transcribe recording
- **AI Processing**:
  - Analyze mood
  - Extract topics
  - Generate hero's journey narrative
- **Sharing**:
  - Create share link
  - Manage share permissions
  - Access shared entry

### API Design Considerations
- RESTful design principles
- GraphQL option for more efficient data fetching
- Versioning strategy
- Rate limiting
- Caching strategy
- Pagination for large result sets

## Sharing Functionality

### Sharing Options
- Public/private toggle
- Link sharing with optional expiration
- Password protection option
- Social media integration
- Email sharing

### Privacy Controls
- Granular permissions (view only, comment, etc.)
- Ability to revoke access
- Analytics on shared content views

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time
- API responses under 200ms for most operations
- Audio upload/download optimized for various connection speeds
- Search and filtering operations optimized

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Load balancing
- Database sharding strategy for large user bases

### Availability
- 99.9% uptime target
- Redundancy planning
- Backup strategy

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Encryption at rest for all data
- Secure transmission (HTTPS)
- Input validation and sanitization

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for European users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data retention policies
- Data export functionality

## Integration Requirements

### Frontend Integration
- Authentication flow
- API client implementation
- Offline capabilities with synchronization
- Error handling and retry logic

### Third-Party Services
- Cloud storage integration options
- AI/ML service integration for advanced analysis
- Email service for notifications
- Analytics integration

## Deployment Considerations

### Hosting Options
- Cloud provider selection (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Serverless vs. traditional hosting
- Database hosting and scaling
- Content Delivery Network for media files

### DevOps
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting
- Logging strategy
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Migration Path

### Data Migration
- Import functionality from localStorage
- Batch migration utilities
- Validation and verification process

### User Experience
- Seamless transition for existing users
- Clear communication about benefits of server-side storage
- Opt-in process for existing users

## Next Steps
1. Select technology stack based on these requirements
2. Design database schema
3. Create API specification
4. Implement authentication system
5. Develop core API endpoints
6. Integrate with frontend
7. Test and optimize
8. Deploy to production
